A simple rust telnet chat server.

Takes usernames on entry and broadcasts join and leave messages with the users given name.

All messages are prepended with the users name to make a busy chatroom readable.

Features an RC4 cipher implementation for encrypting communication (RC4 is no longer considered secure this is just for learning/fun purposes)
