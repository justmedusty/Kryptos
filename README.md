Client : https://github.com/justmedusty/Kryptos-Client/tree/master

An encrypted rust telnet chat server.

Takes usernames on entry and broadcasts join and leave messages with the users given name.

All messages are prepended with the users name to make a busy chatroom readable.

Cryptography offerings so far :
RC4 (Unsafe)
AES ECB (Unsafe)
AES CTR
AES CBC

Planned offerings :
ChaCha
Salsa
RSA, ECC Algos

This is just my pet project for learning rust and cryptography better.
